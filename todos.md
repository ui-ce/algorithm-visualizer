# Suggestions for Further Research

Given the vast potential, appeal, and effectiveness of this project, there are numerous opportunities for its development and expansion. This project, by offering a powerful solution for implementing and visualizing algorithms, serves as a starting point for introducing new features and further improvements. To enhance this project and better utilize its capabilities, the following suggestions are presented. These can help extend its application scope, increase its efficiency, and improve the user experience.

1. **Adding Graph-Related Algorithms**:  
   By incorporating graph-related algorithms into the project, its range of applications can be significantly expanded. Algorithms such as shortest path (e.g., Dijkstra) and spanning tree algorithms (e.g., Kruskal and Prim) could be added to the library. These additions would allow users to perform more comprehensive analyses of graph structures and model more complex problems.

2. **Input File Support**:  
   Adding the ability to receive input in the form of files can streamline the use of the project. With this feature, users will be able to upload their data and parameters from text files and easily view the results of algorithmic analyses. This capability would be particularly beneficial for users dealing with large and complex datasets.

3. **Generating Animated Outputs**:  
   In addition to LaTeX output generation, the ability to produce animated images of the various stages of the algorithms can help improve and make the results more engaging. Animated visuals can sequentially display algorithmic processes in motion, which would be especially useful for educational purposes and visual presentations.

4. **Enabling Joint Algorithm Implementation**:  
   To increase flexibility and functionality, the option to call several algorithms together via the definition of a new function could be added. This feature would allow users to implement multiple algorithms simultaneously and view the results in an integrated manner. For example, combining sorting algorithms with search algorithms or graph algorithms with data processing algorithms could create new use cases.

5. **Support for Different Page Types and Sizes**:  
   To enhance user satisfaction, adding support for output image alignment with A5 and Beamer page formats could also be useful.

By implementing these suggestions, the project can become a more comprehensive and powerful tool that responds to more diverse needs of users and improves algorithmic analysis and visualization capabilities to a higher level.
